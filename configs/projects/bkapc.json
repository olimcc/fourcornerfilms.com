    "summary": "Two decades after Joshua Grannell gave birth to his bold, brazen, busty alter- ego, Peaches Christ has become a beloved cult icon. This lush, intimate portrait offers a rare candid glimpse into the pre-show transformation of San Francisco's most sought-after drag queen. Both man and queen get personal as they discuss transgression, catharsis, and how by becoming someone else, Joshua learned to love himself.",
